# AngularChallenge


Welcome to the Health Recovery Solutions coding challenge. This is a basic login application using recent version of Angular and Typescript. Your challenge is to do the following:

* Fix any compiling errors before running
## Gaurav Balyan-> All the compiler errors have been resolved.(Please use node version <=12.22.1)

* Add an edit user feature using the mock backend to edit the user's name and store a timestamp for each time the user is edited. You can implement this however you see fit and do not necessarily need to show the timestamps in the UI.
## Gaurav Balyan-> Edit user feature has been implemented and I have done it in a reusable and more maintainable way by reusing the add user feature and integrating edit within the already built component.

* Add some tests throughout the application, including 3 - 5 tests in each of the existing pre-built test file as well as thoroughly testing all of your new functions (with new test files if needed).
## Gaurav Balyan-> I have added test coverage for all the component and services files in the application. Please view the coverage by running `ng test --code-coverage`

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
